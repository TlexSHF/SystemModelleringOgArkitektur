## What is object oriented programming?

A way of programming. To organize your code.
2 things: Objects and Data
Vs procedure-oriented: Repeat code (Old times: Very redundant)
Shift logic from: piping the data -> what to do with the data
Manipulating data. Extracting functionalities.


## What are the basic concepts of OOP?

  **- Encapsulation
    - Abstraction
    - Polymorphism
    - Inheritance.  **

## What are the main principles of OOP?

  **- Reusability. 
    - Reduce complexity.
    - Scalable.  **

## Encapsulation

_Bundling_ - "puts multiple different items together into one"
Protecting and hiding data
Wrapping data and methods within one unit
Hide attributes
Name mangling (python)

Types of Encapsulation:
  **- Public
    - Protected
    - Private  **

Why use it:
  **- Security
    - Data Hiding
    - Simplicity
    - Aesthetics  **


## Abstraction

Enables the user to use code without knowing everything beneath the code.
An example: GUI

Prevents code repetition
Improves flexibility
Working in large teams
Data Abstraction

## Inheritance

Modular codebase.
Key advantage: Changing one piece in the parent class, changes what happens in all subclasses.
Concrete vs Abstract methods

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is...
