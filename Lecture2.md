# What is UML (Unified Modelling Language)

- General-purpose visual modeling language
- Specify, visualize, construct and document the artifacts of a software system
- Decisions and understanding about systems must be constructed
- Understand, design, browse...

Gives the stakeholder some diagram about what is happening

UML is an iterative proces embedded in programming a software

#### Who reads a UML diagram?
Stakeholders AND Coders
Both the payer but also who is affected
UML makes communication between Coders and Stakeholders easier.

100 hours of code -> 300 hours of UML diagrams (When UML comes after the code is written)
UML first -> code after (much less)

### Is it a Standard?
UML specification does not define a standard process, but should be used iterative throughout the development process.
UML is not a programming language
UML is general purpose
Written to created to simplify and UNIFY the OOP methodology that had emerged
    (Was originally made for OOP) (UNIFIED - MODELLING - LANGUAGE)
Not perfect -> was created in the "old days" of systems
Programming/Software is not formalised yet

Is there a standard? -> How high is the risk? -> What happens to a person if something fails?
There is a Standard -> Does not mean it is implemented with a UML diagram

#### Is it Enforced?
-> Nope

### Benefits of UML
- Simplifies work for both engineers AND non-engineers
- Gives structure to systems
- Unites programming languages
- Better general understanding before actually creating the system
- Future maintanance
- Makes it easier to convert a system to another platform/language/etc

- Quick understanding -- Abstraction
- Simplify ANY system
- Communicate design decisions
- Independent of technology used
- System handover

# Types of UML Diagrams
#### Structural - what it looks like - the structure
**- Class
  - Object
  - Package
  - Component
  - Composite structure
  - Deployment
  - Profile

#### Behaviour - what it does - the behaviour
**- Use case
**- Activity
**- Sequence
  - State
  - Communication
  - Interaction overview
  - Timing

## Complexity of UML
UML is important -> But not necessarily critical
**Flaws:
- You cannot interpret it literally
- Bi-directional arrows
- To complex classes can not be fitted into a box

*UML is a Product of consesus of people with varied goals and interests.
It is not clean or coherent
Contains superflous features (but people still disagree)
Contains overlapping features that are not always well integrated
Lacks a consistent viewpoint

Tension between concepts for conceptual modeling and programming language representation 
    -> No consistent guidelines
You do not have to know or use every feature of UML!
Don't listen to the UML language lawyers

Contradictions everywhere!
UML is not only a visual notation
    - Can be used to "generate" code and test cases
    
    
## The 4 diagrams
   Use  Case   -   Class   -   Acitivty   -   Sequence
Stakeholders <----------------------------- > Engineers


## OO Analysis and Design
If UML won place 1. -> this won place 2.
1. Identify objects
2. Define relationships
3. Establish Interface
4. Making design executable

^ Some flaws: Is not iterative, objects and technology evolves, and this is not embedded into the model

#### Monoliths and Microservices
Microservices: Multiple boxes that can be deployed separately
Monoliths: One large deployment of everything (or many things...)
